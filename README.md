## About Win32API: ##

Win32API is a plugin for 4th Dimension that lets your Windows applications take advantage of Windows-specific features that are not exposed by native 4th Dimension commands. Win32API lets you set a custom icon for any window, change the name of your 4D application in the title bar and task bar, customize file open and save dialogs, get information from the Regional Settings control panel, and much more.

Win32API is provided free of charge to the 4D developer community, with complete source code. 

Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/OrchardSoftware/4D-Win32API/releases/latest).

Win32API is developed in Visual Studio 2013 and is not compatible with older versions of Visual Studio. 

Win32API has been tested with 4D v15. If you need to support older versions of 4D or versions of Windows older than Windows XP SP3, please use an older version of Win32API.

Orchard Software does not provide technical support for this plugin, but we do appreciate hearing about any problems you discover. To report a problem, send an email to [William Ford](mailto:wford@orchardsoft.com).
